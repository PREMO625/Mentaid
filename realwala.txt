    - ABSTRACT
        
        **Mentaid** is an AI-assisted mental health journaling and clinical insight platform designed to support early detection and monitoring of psychological conditions through user-generated written content. This initial implementation focuses on leveraging digital journaling as a low-friction, privacy-preserving, and behaviorally rich method for detecting early signs of schizophrenia.
        
        The platform includes two interfaces: a patient dashboard for secure, daily mood tracking and journaling, and a clinician interface that visualizes AI-generated insights, SOAP-style summaries, and clinically interpretable signals. Journals are encrypted end-to-end to ensure data privacy, and shared with clinicians only with explicit patient consent.
        
        The backend integrates NLP pipelines including SVMs trained on mental health Reddit data and transformer-based models like MentalBERT. Explainability tools such as SHAP, LIME, coherence scoring, and LIWC-based linguistic markers are used to generate transparent, interpretable outputs. Summaries are auto-generated using instruction-tuned LLMs via OpenRouter.
        
        Mentaid’s first phase establishes a scalable, modular foundation for AI-powered mental health support, using journaling as a personalized input channel. Future phases aim to expand to other disorders, incorporate voice and wearable data, and enhance clinical interoperability through FHIR standards.
        
    - Synopsis
        
        **Mentaid** is a modular, AI-assisted journaling and clinical insight platform designed to support early detection and monitoring of mental health conditions. The platform is built around the idea that regular, written self-expression—through structured or unstructured journaling—can serve as a rich source of behavioral and linguistic signals useful for clinical evaluation.
        
        This project focuses on the first implementation phase of Mentaid, aimed at detecting early signs of schizophrenia through natural language processing (NLP) and explainable AI. The system includes two distinct interfaces: one for patients to securely record daily mood scores and journal entries, and another for clinicians to review AI-generated insights, SOAP-style summaries, and interpretable visualizations.
        
        Journals are end-to-end encrypted using Fernet encryption and are only accessible to clinicians based on explicit patient consent. The backend integrates support vector machines (SVMs) trained on mental health Reddit corpora, transformer-based models like MentalBERT, and clinical signal extraction using SHAP, LIME, LIWC, and coherence-based markers. Summarization of patient input into SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format is achieved via instruction-tuned large language models accessed through OpenRouter.
        
        Designed using FastAPI for the backend and Streamlit or Gradio for the front-end, the platform utilizes MongoDB Atlas for encrypted storage and Cloudinary for secure image hosting. All interactions between user and system are protected via JWT authentication, and every component is designed to be modular and scalable, enabling future integration of voice-based journaling, wearable device data, and FHIR-compliant exports.
        
        Through this phase, Mentaid demonstrates how AI can be safely and meaningfully integrated into digital mental health tools, balancing interpretability, privacy, and clinical utility.
        
    - Introduction
        
        ## 🧾 **3. Introduction**
        
        ---
        
        ### 📌 **3.1 General Introduction**
        
        > Mental health disorders, especially those involving early-stage symptoms such as hallucinations, social withdrawal, or disorganized thought patterns, often go unnoticed due to stigma, limited access to mental healthcare, or a lack of self-reporting tools. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve outcomes, particularly in conditions like schizophrenia. However, most conventional diagnosis methods require clinical visits, structured interviews, and long-term observation — which are not always accessible or scalable.
        > 
        > 
        > In an increasingly digital world, AI-driven tools present a promising opportunity to augment traditional mental healthcare by enabling users to self-monitor, journal their experiences, and receive clinically meaningful insights in real-time. Our project, **Mentaid**, aims to fill this gap using natural language processing and interpretable machine learning to analyze written journal entries and deliver insights to both patients and clinicians.
        > 
        
        ---
        
        ### 🌐 **3.2 Digitalization in the Mental Health Ecosystem**
        
        > Over the past decade, there has been a surge in mobile mental health applications and teletherapy platforms. Many focus on meditation, mood tracking, or chatbot-based support. However, few systems combine structured journaling with AI-driven clinical insights, while maintaining data privacy and interpretability.
        > 
        > 
        > Digital journaling, when combined with NLP and behavior analysis, can serve as a scalable, low-barrier, and user-friendly way to detect patterns in mental health deterioration — particularly when users are reluctant to speak openly in therapy or don’t have immediate access to professionals. Mentaid leverages this digital journaling trend to offer an evidence-based, privacy-conscious solution that supports early-stage detection and clinical decision-making.
        > 
        
        ---
        
        ### 📚 **3.3 Existing Work**
        
        > Several mental health applications like Wysa, Woebot, and Youper utilize chat-based or CBT-based approaches to support users. On the research side, numerous studies have applied NLP techniques to analyze social media posts for mental health prediction. Tools like LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), coherence models, and SHAP/LIME explainability methods have shown promise in detecting signals of depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.
        > 
        > 
        > However, most of these tools either do not offer clinician-facing insights, or rely on non-consensual social data (like Twitter or Reddit posts), limiting their real-world utility. Furthermore, many lack transparency, modularity, or end-to-end privacy guarantees — all of which Mentaid is designed to solve.
        > 
        
        ---
        
        ### 💡 **3.4 Motivation**
        
        > Our motivation stemmed from the observation that while people often journal about their mental state, there is rarely a structured system that analyzes those entries to provide actionable clinical insights. Many patients are unable to access care in the early stages of a disorder, and clinicians often lack longitudinal behavioral data to support diagnoses.
        > 
        > 
        > Mentaid seeks to empower users by giving them a safe, private space to express themselves, while allowing AI models to extract behavioral and linguistic markers that can aid in early diagnosis. At the same time, clinicians benefit from structured dashboards, summaries, and visualizations — all while respecting user consent boundaries.
        > 
        
        ### 🎯 **3.5 Objective and Scope**
        
        The objective of this Phase One implementation is to develop a secure, modular, and scalable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Mentaid platform. The system is designed to support early detection of mental health signals—specifically targeting schizophrenia in this phase—through digital journaling, natural language processing, and interpretable AI models.
        
        The solution includes the following core components:
        
        - 🔐 **Encrypted journaling and mood tracking** for patients, with privacy-preserving data storage using Fernet encryption.
        - 🧠 **NLP-based classification** of schizophrenia indicators using both Support Vector Machines (SVM) trained on Reddit mental health datasets and transformer-based models such as MentalBERT.
        - 📝 **AI-generated SOAP summaries** for clinicians, created through instruction-tuned large language models to support professional review.
        - 📊 **Clinically interpretable visualizations** using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), and coherence-based markers.
        - 🧍‍♂️🧑‍⚕️ **Dual interface system**: A patient-facing dashboard for journaling and a clinician-facing dashboard for secure, consent-based insight review.
        
        The scope of this report and project is limited to the successful implementation and demonstration of the above features under Phase One. Future expansions—including voice-based journaling, conversational LLM integration, wearable health data analysis, and compliance with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards—are out of scope for this phase but are planned for future iterations and are discussed in the conclusion and future work sections.

        ### 🧠 **4.2 System Overview**
        
        Mentaid is a privacy-preserving, AI-assisted mental health journaling platform with two user roles: the patient and the clinician. Patients self-report daily mood scores and maintain digital journals, while clinicians access AI-generated summaries and linguistic analysis of these entries. The backend is responsible for handling secure authentication, storing encrypted entries, and invoking NLP pipelines for classification and analysis.
        
        ---
        
        ### ⚙️ **4.3 NLP and Classification Approach**
        
        The NLP pipeline classifies journal entries as either **CTRL** or **SCZ-like** based on both traditional and transformer-based models:
        
        ### 🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        
        - Trained on [Reddit Mental Health Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/3941387), using:
            - `r/schizophrenia` as positive class
            - `r/meditation`, `r/parenting`, `r/finance`, `r/teaching` as control
        - Preprocessing: Stopword removal, lemmatization
        - Feature extraction: TF-IDF vectorization
        - Model: Linear SVM with stratified K-fold cross-validation
        
        ### 🔹 MentalBERT (Transformer Fine-tuning)
        
        - MentalBERT model fine-tuned using Reddit dataset
        - Tokenized using 512-token chunks, trained on HuggingFace + PyTorch
        - Evaluation: F1-score, confidence thresholds
        - Ensemble logic: Combines SVM + MentalBERT prediction via majority voting
        
        ---
        
        ### 🧠 **4.4 Explainability and Signal Interpretation**
        
        To make NLP outputs clinically usable, we integrated multiple explainability tools:
        
        - **SHAP:** Highlights words contributing most to classification
        - **LIME:** Entry-specific explanation per token
        - **LIWC-style signals:** Pronoun usage, emotional tone, negations, disfluencies
        - **Coherence Scoring:** Detects thought disorder patterns
        
        All insights are visualized on the clinician dashboard.
        
        ---
        
        ### 📝 **4.5 LLM-Generated SOAP Summaries**
        
        Each journal entry is summarized into SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format using LLMs via OpenRouter:
        
        - Models used: `mistral-7b-instruct`, `claude-3-haiku`
        - System prompt guides summary structure
        - Result is shared with clinicians **only if patient consents**
        - Enhances clinician readability and report generation
        
        ---
        
        ### 🔐 **4.6 Security, Consent & Privacy Design**
        
        - Journals are **encrypted end-to-end** using Fernet
        - JWT-based login for both user types
        - Consent toggle: Patient controls if raw entries can be seen by clinician
        - Passwords are hashed using `passlib[bcrypt]`
        - Clinician access is logged (audit logs planned for Phase 2)
        
        ---
        
        ### 👥 **4.7 User Interfaces (Dual Role System)**
        
        | User Role | Key Features |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Patient** | Secure login, profile setup, daily mood slider, journal editor (manual + prompt), quote of the day |
        | **Clinician** | Add patient by ID, view patient card, SOAP summary, toggle between summary/raw/analysis view, SHAP/LIME visualizations |
        
        Both interfaces are built with **Streamlit**, offering quick interaction with the backend API for all operations.
        
        ---
        
        ### 🏗️ **4.8 Modular and Scalable Architecture**
        
        Mentaid is developed with modularity as a core principle:
        
        - All backend routes organized by user type
        - NLP pipeline separated into reusable service classes
        - Future integrations planned:
            - 🎙️ Speech-to-text journaling (Phase 2)
            - 🧠 Prompt-based LLM journaling (Phase 2)
            - 🧘 Wearables and physiological tracking (Phase 3)
            - 📤 FHIR-compliant export for hospitals
        
        ---
        
        ### 🌐 **4.9 Deployment Strategy (MVP)**
        
        For Phase 1:
        
        - Backend is deployed locally or to Railway (Free-tier)
        - Frontend hosted via Streamlit Cloud or local server
        - `.env` secrets managed with `.env.template` + `config.py`
        
        In later phases, frontend will be migrated to React + Tailwind UI with Vercel hosting for performance and flexibility.
        
    - Literature survey
        - the content before the table
            
            ## 🧾 **5. Literature Survey**
            
            In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), and large language models (LLMs) for identifying and monitoring mental health conditions such as schizophrenia. This literature review explores the current landscape of academic research and applied technologies, identifies the key limitations across these approaches, and presents how **Mentaid** fills the existing gaps through an innovative, privacy-focused, and clinically interpretable journaling system.
            
            ---
            
            ### 📚 **5.1 Existing Research**
            
            Numerous studies have explored the linguistic and semantic characteristics of individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ), particularly focusing on coherence, disorganization, and semantic drift in speech and text. Research like *Exploring the Use of NLP for Objective Assessment of Schizophrenia* (2023) and *Semantic Characteristics of Schizophrenic Speech* (2019) demonstrates that NLP-based features can accurately predict symptom severity and offer quantitative tools for diagnosis.
            
            Additionally, transformer models like BERT and MentalBERT have shown promising results in studies such as *Early Depression Detection with Transformer Models* (2021), where Reddit data was used to train interpretable and performant models for mental health prediction. Meta-analyses such as *NLP and Schizophrenia: A Scoping Review* (2024) and *Linguistic Findings in Persons with Schizophrenia* (2023) confirm that coherence loss and lexical abnormalities are consistent linguistic markers in SCZ.
            
            Social media–based research, including *Linguistic Analysis of Schizophrenia in Reddit Posts* (2019) and *Analyzing Schizophrenic Texts from Social Media Through ML and NLP* (2024), validates Reddit as a scalable data source for detecting early symptoms using LIWC features, TF-IDF, and supervised models.
            
            ---
            
            ### 💻 **5.2 Existing Technologies**
            
            A few mental health tools and research prototypes incorporate conversational AI or journaling interfaces, but they tend to focus on mood disorders like depression and anxiety. For example, *MindfulDiary* (2023) and *MindScape* (2024) demonstrate how LLMs can support guided journaling and behavioral sensing. However, these platforms lack integration with clinical explainability tools or schizophrenia-specific features.
            
            Meanwhile, some speech-focused systems like *Sch-net* and *ASR-NLP pipelines* offer near real-time voice-based detection, but they require clinical-grade datasets, lack journaling support, and often ignore explainability and user consent management.
            
            Lastly, major platforms like Woebot, Wysa, and Youper offer AI companions for CBT and mood tracking, but their underlying models are opaque, and they do not provide clinicians with transparent insights or structured reports like SOAP.
            
            ---
            
            ### ❌ **5.3 Identified Gaps in the Literature & Tools**
            
            Despite the advancements in NLP and AI for mental health, the following gaps persist:
            
            | Gap | Explanation |
            | --- | --- |
            | **Lack of clinically interpretable output** | Most tools provide black-box predictions without SHAP, LIME, or LIWC insights. |
            | **Insufficient support for SCZ detection** | Existing tools focus on depression/anxiety; schizophrenia detection is underrepresented. |
            | **No dual-interface platforms** | Very few systems allow both patients and clinicians to interact with journaling data meaningfully. |
            | **Missing secure journaling pipelines** | Journals are often stored in plaintext, raising privacy concerns. |
            | **Absence of consent-aware data sharing** | Tools rarely give patients control over what clinicians can view (raw, summary, analysis). |
            | **No modular backends for expansion** | Most research prototypes are single-purpose and not built for scale or multi-disorder analysis. |
            
            ---
            
            ### ✅ **5.4 How Mentaid Addresses These Gaps**
            
            **Mentaid** directly tackles these limitations through a technically rigorous and user-centered architecture:
            
            - Uses **MentalBERT + SVM** ensemble classifiers trained on real-world Reddit mental health data
            - Provides **explainable AI** outputs via **SHAP**, **LIME**, **LIWC**, and coherence markers
            - Supports **SOAP summaries** generated by LLMs for clinician readability
            - Separates frontend into **dual interfaces** — one for patients, one for clinicians
            - Enables **end-to-end encryption** of journal entries using Fernet
            - Introduces a **consent management layer** where patients can choose how much to share
            - Designed with a **modular backend**, ready for STT, LLM journaling, and wearable integration in future phases
            
            ---
            
            Through these innovations, Mentaid offers a unique, scalable, and clinically-aligned solution that bridges the gap between raw journaling and actionable mental health insights — something not yet realized in existing literature or products.

        Through this project, several deep insights emerged:
        
        - **Language is diagnostic**: Subtle shifts in linguistic structure, coherence, and pronoun use can act as early indicators of mental health shifts — particularly in psychosis-spectrum disorders.
        - **Explainability boosts trust**: Clinicians are more likely to engage with AI when its decisions are traceable and interpretable.
        - **Consent matters**: Giving users control over their data-sharing preferences increases system transparency and potential adoption.
        - **Journaling ≠ simple text**: Journal entries reflect deeply emotional, nonlinear thought patterns — and require specialized models to process meaningfully.
        - **Transformer models are powerful** but computationally expensive — traditional ML still holds ground for fast, low-latency screening.

        ### 🚧 **9.3 Limitations**
        
        While Mentaid achieves its Phase 1 goals, several limitations remain:
        
        | Area | Limitation |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Model Generalization** | Training data (Reddit posts) may not fully represent formal journal entries or clinical notes. |
        | **Deployment Constraints** | MVP is hosted in free-tier environments; may not scale well under real-time, concurrent loads. |
        | **STT & Wearables** | Speech-to-text journaling and physiological tracking are scoped for future phases. |
        | **User Testing** | No live patient or clinician testing was conducted due to scope and time limits. |
        | **Language Scope** | Currently supports only English; multilingual adaptation is needed. |

        ### 🌱 **9.4 Future Scope**
        
        The modular architecture of Mentaid allows it to evolve beyond the MVP and incorporate advanced capabilities in future phases:
        
        ### 🔹 **Phase 2**:
        
        - Integration of **Whisper-based speech-to-text journaling**
        - Addition of **conversational LLMs** for prompt-based self-reflection
        - Clinician **feedback loops and progress notes**
        - Real-time notifications for crisis flagging
        
        ### 🔹 **Phase 3**:
        
        - Syncing with **wearable health devices** (HRV, sleep, steps)
        - FHIR-compatible export for **hospital integration and EHR systems**
        - **Longitudinal analytics** to detect relapse risk and monitor behavioral improvement
        - Support for **multiple mental health disorders** beyond schizophrenia (e.g., BPD, depression, anxiety)

        ### ✨ **9.5 Final Remarks**
        
        Mentaid demonstrates how **AI + NLP + empathy-first design** can create impactful solutions for modern mental health care. With a commitment to privacy, explainability, and patient empowerment, the system shows that it's possible to **detect clinical insights from everyday language** — without compromising safety or dignity.
        
        The work done in Phase 1 lays a solid foundation for future development into a full-scale AI-powered clinical companion — and represents a step forward in making mental health tech smarter, safer, and more human.
