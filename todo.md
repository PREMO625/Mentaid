for the journal entry:Today was long, but honestly not bad. I woke up a little later than planned, around 9:15 AM. I’d stayed up watching some documentary about deep-sea creatures — I don’t even know why I was so into it, but it was fascinating. I made myself some eggs and toast, and while cooking, I started thinking about that conversation I had with Neha yesterday — about how people just grow apart without realizing it. It’s weird how quickly friendships can feel distant when life just… moves on.

Anyway, work was manageable today. I responded to a few emails and finally finished that annoying presentation deck that’s been sitting in my drafts for 3 days. Around lunchtime, I went for a short walk. I’ve been trying to get more sun lately because honestly, I don’t even remember the last time I didn’t feel tired midday. The walk helped.

I got a random notification from Spotify — apparently my old playlist from 2018 was resurfacing. I listened to it while working and wow... memories. Some of those songs instantly transported me back to those long bus rides to college and nights cramming for exams. It’s funny how music does that, right? Anchors you.

In the evening, I cooked pasta and watched the first episode of The Bear — everyone kept recommending it. Super intense. I can tell it’s gonna be one of those shows that makes me overthink life. I started journaling around 10 PM just to decompress. I don’t feel anxious, just… reflective.

Overall mood: probably an 8. Today had a weirdly good rhythm. I didn’t feel overwhelmed, didn’t feel invisible, didn’t spiral. I think I might be healing in small ways. Anyway, I’m logging off and planning to wake up early to try that sunrise run I keep talking about but never doing.

**NOTE:AS you can see the explanability is repeating in each one and the liwc analsyis is just written in meancitc coherence and thats it so you need to resolve this**
