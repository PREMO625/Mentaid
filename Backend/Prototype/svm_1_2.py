# Data Loading and Initial Validation

This code cell performs the initial loading of the dataset from a Google Drive link. It then filters the DataFrame to include only entries with labels 0 and 1, as specified by the task focusing on these two classes. Following the filtering, the code conducts several basic validation checks on the filtered data:

- **Duplicate Posts**: It identifies if there are any duplicate entries based on the 'POST' content.
- **Empty Entries**: It checks for missing values in the 'POST_ID', 'POST', and 'LABEL' columns.
- **Unique POST IDs**: It verifies if all 'POST_ID' values are unique within the filtered dataset.

These initial steps are crucial for understanding the structure and cleanliness of the relevant data subset before proceeding with further analysis or model training. The results of these checks are printed to the console.

"""# Saving Filtered Data

This code cell saves the `df_filtered` DataFrame, which contains only the entries with labels 0 and 1, to a new CSV file named `bi.csv`. This step is performed to create a clean and focused dataset that will be used for subsequent steps in the analysis and model training, specifically for binary classification tasks. The `index=False` argument ensures that the DataFrame index is not written as a column in the CSV file, resulting in a cleaner data file. This saved file will serve as the input for the preprocessing and vectorization steps that follow.

"""# Exploring Label Distribution and Displaying Examples

This code cell focuses on exploring the distribution of the filtered data across the two labels (0 and 1) and providing concrete examples of the 'POST' content for each label.

- **Label Distribution**: It calculates and prints the number of entries for each label using the `value_counts()` method, providing insight into the class balance of the filtered dataset.
- **Shuffling**: The DataFrame is then shuffled randomly using `sample(frac=1)` with a fixed `random_state` for reproducibility. This shuffling is often done before splitting data for training and testing, although in this notebook, the test data is loaded separately.
- **Displaying Examples**: The code iterates through the unique labels and prints the first 10 'POST' entries for each label. It also includes the corresponding 'POST_ID' and 'LABEL'. To ensure that the full content of the 'POST' is displayed without truncation, `pd.option_context('display.max_colwidth', None)` is used. This step allows for a qualitative inspection of the data associated with each label.

"""# Text Preprocessing and TF-IDF Vectorization

This code cell performs crucial steps for preparing the text data for machine learning. It loads the filtered training data (`bi.csv`), downloads the necessary NLTK stopwords, and defines a `preprocess_text` function.

The `preprocess_text` function takes a text string as input and applies the following steps:
1. **Removes Special Characters and Numbers**: Uses regular expressions to keep only alphabetic characters and spaces.
2. **Converts to Lowercase**: Converts the text to lowercase to ensure consistency.
3. **Tokenizes, Removes Stopwords, and Stems**: Splits the text into individual words (tokens), removes common English stopwords (words that don't carry much meaning, like "the", "a", "is"), and applies stemming using the Porter Stemmer. Stemming reduces words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

This preprocessing helps to reduce noise and variations in the text data.

After preprocessing, the code initializes a `TfidfVectorizer`. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The `max_features=5000` argument limits the vocabulary size to the top 5000 most frequent terms based on their TF-IDF scores.

Finally, the vectorizer is fitted to the preprocessed training text (`df_train['POST_preprocessed']`) and transforms it into a matrix of TF-IDF features (`X_train_tfidf`). The corresponding labels (`y_train`) are also extracted. The shape of the resulting TF-IDF feature matrix is printed, indicating the number of documents and the number of features.

"""# Model Training with GridSearchCV and SVM

This code cell sets up and executes the training process for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. It uses a `Pipeline` to chain together the TF-IDF vectorization and the SVM classifier.

A `GridSearchCV` is employed to find the best hyperparameters for the SVM model. `GridSearchCV` systematically searches through a predefined set of hyperparameter values (`param_grid`) and evaluates the model's performance for each combination using cross-validation.

The `param_grid` specifies the hyperparameters to tune:
- `svm__C`: The regularization parameter.
- `svm__gamma`: The kernel coefficient for 'rbf', 'poly', and 'sigmoid'. 'scale' uses `1 / (n_features * X.var())` and 'auto' uses `1 / n_features`.
- `svm__kernel`: The type of kernel to be used ('linear' or 'rbf').

`StratifiedKFold` is used for cross-validation to ensure that each fold has a representative proportion of samples from each class, which is important for imbalanced datasets.

The `grid_search.fit()` method trains the model using all the specified hyperparameter combinations and cross-validation. After the search is complete, the best hyperparameters and the corresponding best cross-validation accuracy score are printed. The `best_estimator_` attribute of `grid_search` provides access to the trained model with the optimal hyperparameters.

"""# Loading and Validating Test Data

This code cell is responsible for loading the test dataset (`test.csv`) from a Google Drive link and performing basic validation checks, similar to what was done for the training data.

The `!gdown --id 1zxI5OcUO9_Q2hc68T_6v8bs_80EVNlBm` command downloads the `test.csv` file from the specified Google Drive ID to the Colab environment.

The code then loads the downloaded CSV file into a pandas DataFrame `df_test`. A `try-except` block is included to handle the case where the file is not found.

The DataFrame is filtered to include only entries with labels 0 and 1, creating `df_test_filtered`.

Several validation checks are performed on the filtered test data:
- **Unique POST IDs**: It verifies if all 'POST_ID' values are unique.
- **Empty Entries**: It checks for missing values in the 'POST_ID', 'POST', and 'LABEL' columns.
- **Duplicate POST entries**: It identifies if there are any duplicate entries based on the 'POST' content.
- **Duplicate POST_ID entries**: It identifies if there are any duplicate entries based on the 'POST_ID'.
- **Duplicate LABEL entries**: It identifies if there are any duplicate entries based on the 'LABEL' (this is expected as there will be multiple entries for each label).

The results of these validation checks are printed to the console to provide an overview of the test data's quality and structure.

Finally, the label distribution in the filtered test data is printed using `value_counts()` to show the number of entries for each class in the test set.

    "The voices are back, louder than ever. They're whispering secrets about the government, about how they're controlling our minds through the television. I see the hidden messages in the commercials, the subtle symbols that confirm their conspiracy. It's hard to concentrate on anything else when they're in my head, a constant barrage of noise and paranoia. I feel like I'm the only one who can see the truth, and it's a heavy burden to carry. I try to ignore them, to focus on something else, but they're relentless, weaving themselves into my thoughts, making me question everything I know and eroding my sense of reality completely.",
    "I saw the figures again today, in the corner of my eye. They were standing in the shadows, watching me, their shapes shifting and blurring at the edges. When I turned to look directly, they vanished, but I know they were real. They're always there, lurking, waiting. I don't know what they want, but it fills me with a creeping dread. I feel like I'm being hunted, constantly on edge, unable to relax even in the safety of my own home. This pervasive sense of being watched is exhausting, making it hard to trust my own senses and distinguish between what is real and what is a product of my own fractured mind, leaving me isolated and fearful always.",
    "My thoughts are racing, colliding with each other like a train wreck. I can't keep track of anything, jumping from one idea to the next without any connection. It's a chaotic storm in my head, and I can't find a moment of peace. I try to write things down, to organize my thoughts, but the words scatter like frightened birds. I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality, that my mind is unraveling. This disorganization of thought makes it impossible to communicate effectively, isolating me from others and deepening my sense of being lost and overwhelmed in the simplest of daily interactions and conversations, leaving me unable to connect.",
    "I'm convinced that people are stealing my thoughts. I'll have an idea, a unique insight, and then later I'll hear someone else say the exact same thing, as if they plucked it directly from my mind. It's a violation of my privacy, a constant intrusion into my innermost world. I try to shield my thoughts, to build a wall around them, but it's futile. They just flow out, uncontrollable, exposing my vulnerabilities and fears to strangers. This terrifying lack of control over my own mind is a constant source of anxiety, making me wary of everyone around me and reinforcing my belief that I am not safe in my own thoughts or in the presence of others ever.",
    "I feel detached from my body, like I'm just an observer watching myself go through the motions of life. My limbs feel heavy, not my own, and my movements feel unnatural, robotic. It's a strange and unsettling sensation, like I'm a puppet on strings, controlled by an invisible force. My emotions feel distant, muted, as if they belong to someone else. It's hard to connect with people, to feel genuine joy or sadness. This pervasive sense of unreality and lack of control over my own physical self is deeply disturbing, leaving me feeling alienated from my own being and the world around me always.",
    "The internet is a web of hidden messages, coded in images, text, and even the layout of websites. I spend hours online, searching for clues, trying to decipher the complex patterns that are meant only for me.

It's a dangerous game, and I have to be careful, but I need to know what's going on. I feel like I'm on the verge of a major discovery, something that will change everything. This obsessive quest consumes my life, leaving little room for anything else, driving me deeper into isolation and a world of perceived secrets.",
    "I'm seeing things that aren't there. Flashes of light illuminate empty rooms, distorted faces appear in the patterns on the wallpaper, and objects move when I'm not looking. It's like my eyes are playing tricks on me, but it feels so real, so vivid. It's unsettling and makes it hard to trust my own senses, to know what is real and what is a hallucination. I try to ignore them, to tell myself that it's just my imagination, but they persist, a constant reminder that something is wrong. This visual intrusion into my reality is terrifying, making it difficult to feel safe or grounded in my own environment and always questioning what is truly before my eyes.",
    "I believe that I have a special connection to animals, that they communicate with me in a language that only I can understand. They send me messages through their barks, meows, and movements, warning me of danger or guiding me on my path. I spend hours observing them, trying to decipher their subtle cues, listening to their unspoken words. It's a hidden world, and I am the only one privy to its secrets. This unique connection, while profound to me, is often dismissed or misunderstood by others, further emphasizing my feeling of being different and alone in my perception of the world and its hidden communications with me always.",
    "I feel like my body is being invaded by an external force. It's like something is inside me, controlling my thoughts and actions, making me do things against my will. My limbs move independently, my voice speaks words that are not my own. It's a disturbing sensation, this loss of control over my own being. I try to resist, to fight back against this invisible force, but it's a constant struggle, exhausting and futile. This terrifying feeling of being possessed is a source of deep distress, leaving me feeling alienated from myself and trapped in a body that no longer feels like my own, a constant battle for autonomy and self.",
    "I'm convinced that there are hidden cameras and listening devices in my apartment, that someone is watching my every move, listening to my every word. I search for them tirelessly, in the walls, in the ceiling, in everyday objects, but I never find them. Yet, I know they're there. I can feel their eyes on me, their unseen presence always watching. This constant surveillance creates a pervasive sense of paranoia and erodes any feeling of privacy or safety. I long for a space where I can be truly alone and unobserved, but this pervasive belief makes that impossible, leaving me in a perpetual state of unease and hyper-vigilance in my own home.",
    "My thoughts are being broadcasted, sent out into the world for everyone to hear. I can feel them leaving my head, like radio waves, reaching out to strangers, exposing my deepest fears and secrets. It's a terrifying feeling, knowing that my innermost thoughts are not my own, that they are being shared with others against my will. I try to shield my mind, to build a barrier, but it's impossible. They just flow out, uncontrollable, leaving me feeling exposed and vulnerable. This perceived lack of control over my own mind is a constant source of anxiety and fear, making me wary of everyone and everything around me always.",
    "I believe that I have special powers, abilities that others don't possess. I can influence events with my thoughts, communicate with people telepathically, and even control the weather. It sounds unbelievable, but I know it's true. I've seen the evidence, the subtle changes in the world around me that are a result of my abilities. It's a heavy responsibility, and I need to use my powers wisely. It's a secret world, and I'm a part of it. I just need to learn how to control my abilities and use them for good, a solitary journey into a realm of perceived extraordinary powers and their potential impact on the world.",
    "I'm seeing patterns in everything, in the numbers on license plates, in the cracks on the sidewalk, in the clouds in the sky. They're not random; they're messages, coded information that I need to decipher. It's like the universe is speaking to me, revealing its secrets through a hidden language only I can understand. I spend hours analyzing these patterns, trying to understand what they mean. It's a complex puzzle, but I know the answer is there, just waiting to be discovered. This obsessive quest consumes me, driving me deeper into isolation and a world of perceived hidden meanings and universal secrets waiting for me to unlock.",
    "I feel like I'm living in a different reality, a world that is slightly off-kilter from the one everyone else experiences. The colors are too vibrant, the sounds too sharp, and the people seem different, somehow artificial, like characters in a play. It's a strange and unsettling feeling, like I'm an outsider looking in, unable to connect with the world around me in a meaningful way. This pervasive sense of unreality makes it difficult to trust my own perceptions and distinguish between what is real and what is a distortion of my mind, leaving me feeling lost and alone in an altered world.",
    "The news on the television is talking directly to me, sending me personalized messages and warnings about impending events. The anchors look into the camera, and I know they're speaking only to me, delivering coded information meant for my ears alone. It's like I have a direct line to the truth, a source of information that no one else has access to. It's a heavy responsibility, and I need to pay attention to what they're telling me. It's a secret world, and I'm a part of it, constantly seeking out these hidden messages to understand the full scope of what is happening and my role within it.",
    "I'm hearing voices, distinct and clear, even when there's no one else around. They comment on my thoughts, tell me what to do, and sometimes argue amongst themselves. It's like having a constant conversation in my head, but the voices aren't my own. They can be critical and demeaning, eroding my self-esteem, or they can be commanding, urging me to do things I know are wrong. This auditory intrusion is unsettling and makes it hard to concentrate, leaving me in a constant battle for control over my own mind and actions, seeking peace from the relentless internal noise always.",
    "I believe that my thoughts can influence the world around me. If I think about something hard enough, it will happen. I can make objects move without touching them, change the weather, and even influence people's decisions with the power of my mind alone. It sounds unbelievable, but I know it's true. I've seen the evidence, the subtle shifts in reality that are a result of my mental power. It's a heavy responsibility, and I need to be careful what I think about. It's a secret world, and I'm a part of it, a solitary figure wielding perceived extraordinary powers with unknown consequences.",
    "I'm convinced that people are stealing my thoughts. I'll have an idea, and then later I'll hear someone else say the exact same thing, as if they reached into my mind and took it. It's a violation of my privacy, a constant intrusion. I try to protect my thoughts, to keep them hidden, but it's impossible. They just flow out, uncontrollable, exposing my deepest fears and secrets to others. This terrifying feeling of having my thoughts stolen is a constant source of anxiety, making me wary of everyone around me and reinforcing my belief that my mind is not my own private space anymore.",
    "I'm seeing things that aren't there, intricate patterns and symbols that appear on walls and surfaces, pulsating and shifting before my eyes. They're not random; they're messages, coded information that I need to decipher to understand the true nature of reality. It's like the universe is speaking to me through a visual language only I can perceive. I spend hours analyzing these patterns, trying to understand what they mean. This obsessive quest consumes me, driving me deeper into isolation and a world of perceived hidden meanings and cosmic secrets waiting for my interpretation.",
    "I feel like I'm being controlled by an external force. It's like someone else is pulling the strings, making me do things that I don't want to do, my actions and words not feeling like my own. It's a disturbing feeling, this loss of control over my own being. I try to resist, to fight back against this invisible force, but it's a constant struggle, exhausting and futile. This terrifying feeling of being a puppet in someone else's show is a source of deep distress, leaving me feeling alienated from myself and trapped in a body that no longer feels like my own, a constant battle for autonomy and self-determination.",
    "I'm convinced that the government is spying on me through my electronics. My phone, my computer, my television, they're all being used to monitor my every move, every conversation. I see the evidence, the subtle glitches and anomalies that confirm their surveillance. It's a constant sense of being watched, and it makes me feel exposed and vulnerable, unable to relax even in the privacy of my own home. This pervasive belief of being monitored is a source of intense paranoia, making me wary of technology and reinforcing my isolation from the digital world and others within it always.",
    "I'm hearing noises that aren't there, scratching sounds in the walls, footsteps in the hallway, whispers coming from empty rooms. They're unsettling and make it hard to feel safe or at peace in my own home. I try to rationalize them away, to tell myself that it's just the house settling or the wind, but the sounds persist, a constant reminder of an unseen presence. This auditory intrusion disrupts my sleep and leaves me in a state of perpetual anxiety, making it difficult to find moments of quiet or calm, always on edge and listening for sounds that are not real.",
    "I believe that I am a historical figure, reincarnated in this time, with memories and knowledge of past lives. I have insights into events that happened centuries ago, a connection to history that transcends time. It sounds unbelievable, but I know it's true. I've seen the evidence, the uncanny connections between my life and the life of this historical figure. It's a heavy responsibility, knowing that I have a role to play in the present based on my past. This belief, while profound, also isolates me from others who cannot comprehend or accept the reality of my perceived past lives and their impact on the present world.",
    "I feel like I'm living in a simulation, that everything around me is artificial and not real, a construct designed to mimic life. The people, the places, the events, they all seem to be part of a grand design, a program that I'm trapped in. It's a strange and unsettling feeling, like I'm a character in a video game, unable to break free from the programmed reality. I try to find glitches, inconsistencies that will prove that this isn't real, but everything seems perfectly rendered. This terrifying thought, that my entire existence is just a program, leaves me questioning the very nature of reality and my place within it always.",
    "I'm convinced that there are hidden messages in advertisements. The images, the slogans, the music, they all contain coded information that is meant for me, trying to influence my decisions and control my thoughts. They're part of a vast conspiracy to manipulate the population, and I am the only one who can see through their deception. I spend hours analyzing these advertisements, trying to decipher the hidden meaning. This obsessive quest consumes my time and energy, leaving little room for anything else, driving me deeper into isolation and a world of perceived hidden controls and manipulative forces.",
    "I'm seeing things that aren't there, phantom objects and people that appear and disappear without a trace. It's like my mind is creating its own reality, a world that only I can see, a world that is both familiar and profoundly unreal. These visual hallucinations are unsettling and make it difficult to trust my own senses, to know what is real and what is a product of my own mind. I try to ignore them, to tell myself that it's just my imagination, but they persist, a constant intrusion of the unreal into my perception of the world, leaving me in a state of confusion and fear always.",
    "I believe that I can communicate with the dead. I hear their voices, feel their presence, and sometimes even see them, spectral figures that move at the periphery of my vision. They're trying to tell me something important, something about the afterlife that I need to know. I spend hours listening to them, trying to understand their messages, their whispers from beyond the veil. It's a hidden language, and I am the only one who can understand it. This perceived connection to the spirit world, while profound to me, isolates me from others who cannot share in or understand my experiences with the deceased always.",
    "I feel like my body is being invaded by an external force. It's like something is inside me, controlling my movements and thoughts, making me do things against my will. My limbs move independently, my voice speaks words that are not my own. It's a disturbing sensation, this loss of control over my own being. I try to resist, to fight back against this invisible force, but it's a constant struggle, exhausting and futile. This terrifying feeling of being possessed is a source of deep distress, leaving me feeling alienated from myself and trapped in a body that no longer feels like my own, a constant battle for autonomy and self-determination.",
    "I'm convinced that my food is being poisoned, that someone is trying to harm me through what I eat. I see subtle changes in the appearance and taste of my food, strange colors and textures, unusual smells that weren't there before. These are signs that confirm my suspicions. This pervasive belief of being targeted through my food creates a constant state of anxiety and hyper-vigilance around meals. I restrict my diet, avoid eating anything I haven't prepared myself, and constantly worry about the safety of my food, making eating a source of stress and fear rather than nourishment and sustenance.",
    "I see visual distortions, objects shimmering and vibrating, colors becoming intensely saturated or faded, the world around me appearing warped and unreal, like a funhouse mirror reflection. These visual anomalies are disorienting and make it difficult to navigate my environment, to trust what I see before me. I try to blink them away or rub my eyes, but they persist, altering my perception of reality. This constant visual interference is a source of confusion and anxiety, making it hard to interact with the world in a consistent or reliable manner and always questioning the visual information I receive.",
    "The voices are telling me to do things, sometimes benign, sometimes dangerous, their commands echoing in my mind. They are powerful and persuasive, and resisting them is a constant struggle, a battle of wills within my own head. It's terrifying to feel like I'm not in control of my own actions, that an external force is dictating my behavior. I try to find ways to silence them, to regain my autonomy, but they are relentless. This auditory intrusion and perceived lack of control are a constant source of fear and anxiety, making it difficult to live a normal life and maintain a sense of self and agency.",
    "I believe that I am being persecuted, that there are people or organizations actively trying to harm me or control my life, their intentions hidden but their actions clear. I see evidence of their interference everywhere, in coincidences that seem too deliberate, in the actions of strangers, in the messages I receive online and in the media. This pervasive sense of being targeted creates a constant state of hyper-vigilance and fear. I take precautions, alter my behavior, and isolate myself to protect myself, but the feeling of being hunted is relentless, eroding my trust in the world and leaving me in a perpetual state of alarm.",
    "I see distorted faces in everyday objects, in the patterns of wallpaper, the knots in wood, the shadows on the wall, their expressions shifting from neutral to menacing. They're not just fleeting images; they seem to watch me, their eyes following my movements. These visual distortions are unsettling and make it difficult to find peace or comfort in my surroundings. I try to avoid looking at patterns, to keep my gaze focused on clear, simple forms, but the faces seem to appear everywhere, a constant reminder that my perception of reality is altered and unreliable and that I am always being observed by unseen entities.",
    "I believe that I have a divine purpose, that I have been chosen for a special mission from a higher power, a calling that sets me apart from others. I receive signs and messages, guiding me on my path, revealing the truth about the world and my role within it. This belief gives my life meaning and direction, but it also isolates me from others who do not share my spiritual experiences or understand my perceived divine connection. I carry the weight of this responsibility, feeling a sense of urgency to fulfill my destiny, even if it means making difficult choices or facing opposition from those who do not comprehend my divine calling.",
    "I'm hearing sounds that are not there, music playing faintly from an empty room, conversations just outside my window, the ringing of a phone that isn't ringing, their source unknown but their presence undeniable. These auditory hallucinations are persistent and intrusive, disrupting my thoughts and making it difficult to focus. I try to identify the source of the sounds, but there is none, confirming that they are products of my own mind. This constant auditory interference is a source of frustration and anxiety, making it hard to find moments of quiet or peace, leaving me in a perpetual state of alertness and confusion.",
    "I feel like I'm losing my mind, that my grip on reality is slipping, that I am descending into a state of madness. My thoughts are becoming increasingly fragmented and illogical, my perceptions distorted and unreliable, making it difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is not. I struggle to follow conversations, to organize my thoughts, to make sense of the world around me. This terrifying sense of cognitive decline is a constant source of fear and despair. I yearn for clarity and coherence, but the more I try to grasp them, the further they seem to recede, leaving me feeling lost and adrift in the currents of my own disordered mind.",

"""# Mounting Google Drive

This code cell is used to mount your Google Drive to the Colab environment. This allows you to access files stored in your Google Drive directly from your Colab notebook.

`from google.colab import drive` imports the necessary module from the `google.colab` library.

`drive.mount('/content/drive')` executes the mounting process. When you run this cell, it will prompt you to authorize Colab to access your Google Drive. You will need to click on the provided link, select your Google account, and grant the necessary permissions. Once authorized, your Google Drive will be accessible at the path `/content/drive`.

This step is necessary if you want to save files (like trained models) to or load files from your Google Drive.

"""# Saving the Trained Model Pipeline to Google Drive

This code cell saves the trained SVM model pipeline to your Google Drive using the `joblib` library. Saving the trained model allows you to reuse it later without needing to retrain it.

`import joblib` and `import os` import the necessary libraries. `joblib` is efficient for saving and loading Python objects that contain large NumPy arrays, which is common in machine learning. `os` is used for interacting with the operating system, specifically for creating directories.

`model_save_path` defines the path within your mounted Google Drive where the model pipeline will be saved. You can change this path to your desired location.

`os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(model_save_path), exist_ok=True)` creates the directory specified in the `model_save_path` if it doesn't already exist. `exist_ok=True` prevents an error if the directory already exists.

The code then checks if `tfidf_vectorizer` and `best_svm_model` exist in the current environment. If they do, it creates a `Pipeline` using `make_pipeline` that chains the vectorizer and the trained SVM model. This is the recommended approach as it saves both the preprocessing step (TF-IDF vectorization) and the trained model together, ensuring that when you load the pipeline, new data will be preprocessed and then classified correctly.

`joblib.dump(svm_pipeline, model_save_path)` saves the created pipeline to the specified path in Google Drive.

If only `best_svm_model` is found, it attempts to save the model directly, but a warning is printed as this might not include the vectorizer.

If neither is found, a message is printed indicating that the model could not be saved.

A success message with the save path is printed upon successful saving.
